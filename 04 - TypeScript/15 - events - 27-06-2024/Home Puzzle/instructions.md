Game Idea: Click to Make Things Disappear, Explode, and Move

use a map in the background.

Use the MVC pattern to separate the game logic from the rendering.

# Level 1: Click to Disappear

Make a Creature: It shows up on the screen.
Click it: The creature disappears!

# Level 2: Explosions!

Click a Creature: It disappears AND...
BOOM! An explosion happens where it was.

# Level 3: Creatures on the Move

Creatures Appear: They start wandering around randomly.
Click to Disappear: Click them, and they disappear with an explosion.
Keep Changing: Every few seconds, creatures pick a new direction to wander in.
