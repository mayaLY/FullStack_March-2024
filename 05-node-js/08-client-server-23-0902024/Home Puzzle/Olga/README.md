# Project Development

The development of this project is ongoing in the repository. You can follow the progress [in hte folder "07-recar-project"](https://github.com/talyaron/FullStack_March-2024/tree/main/05-node-js/07-recap-project/Olga).

## Running the Project

Both the server-side and client-side need to be started separately. Follow the steps below to run the project.

### 1. Running the Server
To start the server, navigate to the server directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will launch the backend on the specified port (usually http://localhost:3000).

### 2. Running the Client
After starting the server, you can start the client. Navigate to the client directory and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Make sure both the server and the client are running simultaneously for the project to work correctly.
